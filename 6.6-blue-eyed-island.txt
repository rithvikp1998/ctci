I saw this riddle on Ted Ed so I knew the answer :(

Assume that all the players play optimally. Suppose I am 
one of the players. On the day, the announcement is made,
I travel the island looking for blue eyed people. 

If I find none and I know that there is atleast one blue-eyed 
person on the island, then I am that person, so I board the plane.

If I find only one other blue-eyed person, I wait for the plane 
to leave once. If on the next day, I find out this person has boarded
the plane, it'd be because I have green eyes and he knew that so he
boarded the plane. If he didn't board the plane, it is because I have
blue eyes and he was waiting to see if I board the plane. On day 2, 
when I come across him, both of us realise we have blue eyes (because
if only one of us did, the other would have boarded the plane on day
1 itself), so we both board the plane one day 2.

If I find two other blue eyed people, I wait for 2 days. If I have green
eyes, those two blue eyed people would have figured out the above point 
on day 2 and left the island on day 2. If they didn't leave on day 2, it'd
because I have blue eyes. So, on day 3, we all figure this out and leave
the island.

So, if there are N blue eyed people in the island, it'll take N days
for all of them to leave.
