My solutions to Cracking The Coding Interview 6th Ed

I have been thinking of attempting the problems from CTCI for a long time but I have been procrastinating.
So, I created this repo to keep me committed. I tried to solve the problems without looking at the hints,
but wherever I did lookup hints, I mentioned it in the code itself. My plan is to first solve all the 
problems as optimally as I can think of, then start from the beginning and read all the hints to see if it 
can be further optimised. However, I couldn't find test cases for all the problems, so the code might fail 
in some test cases or be outright incorrect if I managed to understand the question differently. Please 
correct me if you find any mistakes.
