1. Test 100 bottles with one strip per batch and send the strips to the lab
2. After one week, we have a batch of 100 bottles which contains
   the poisoned one and 9 strips left.
3. Test 11 bottles with one strip per batch (one batch will contain 12 bottles)
   and send the strips to the lab.
4. After one week, we have a batch of 11/12 bottles which contains
   the poisoned one and 8 strips left.
5. Test 1/2 bottle batches with 8 strips and send the strips to the lab
6. After one week, we either know the poisoned bottle or we have to wait
   one more week to differntiate between two bottles. 

In the worst case scenario, we have to wait 4 weeks.
