I had to look at hint #367 to figure out the answer :(

A single domino placed in either vertical or horizontal orientation
covers one black square and one white square. In a 8x8 chessboard
with corners cut off, there are 2 extra squares of one color (since
the diagonally opposite corners of a chessboard are of the same 
color), so it is impossible to cover the chessboard with dominos.
