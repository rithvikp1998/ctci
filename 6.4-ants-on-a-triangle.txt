Assuming the ants stop walking after they collide,
the only way they don't collide at all is if they
all start walking in the same direction. In a triangle,
the probability of that happening is 2*((1/2)^3).
Therefore, the probability of collision is 1-2*((1/2)^3).
For a n-vertex polygon, the probability of collision is
1-2*((1/2)^n).
